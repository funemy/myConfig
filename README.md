This is a list of configurations in my own computer

## Mac

- **MyABC.keylayout** <br>
a clean key layout without dog fucked Latin characters

*sadly this layout can no longer be used in macOS 10.12*

## Atom

- **config.cson**<br>
my atom configuration
- **keymap.cson**<br>
my atom customized key bind
- **sytle.less**<br>
my atom customized sytle sheet

the selection area will be more clear while not conflicting with most themes

## vim
- **init.vim**
- **.vimrc**

use `init.vim` for neovim and `.vimrc` for vim(>8)
the `.vimrc` is very light-weighted and only support python
since I found now I only use terminal vim for some small python script.

I switch back from neovim to vim because vim8 now is working just fine, and deoplete is not working properly, so I replace it with completor.

place `init.vim` at `~/.config/neovim`

using `vim-plug` to manage plugin

## Shadowrocket
- **shadowrocket-usa.conf**<br>
Still testing<br>
A config file for people living in USA<br>
Mainly for unblocking Netease Music and Bilibili<br>
